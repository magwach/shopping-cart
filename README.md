**📜 Usage Guide**

    Browse through available products.
    Click the "Add to Cart" button to add an item.
    Navigate to the cart section to view added products.
    Adjust item quantities using the increment/decrement buttons.

    The total price updates dynamically.
    Refreshing the page retains cart items (thanks to Local Storage).

Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
